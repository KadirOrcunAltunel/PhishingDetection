Phishing is considered to be a form of a cybersecurity attack, where emails or any other type
of electrical communication is sent by an attacker, who impersonates to be someone else. This
type of attack usually tries to obtain sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords,
credit card numbers, or other personal data. There are several clues that might give away a
phishing attack, such as misspelled URLs, the use of public email addresses instead of well-
known ones, asking for personal information, etc. However, the methods used in this type of
cybersecurity attacks have evolved over time and are becoming very sophisticated, to the
point where they can be very hard to distinguish.

There are several types of phishing attacks, each one has its own characteristics. Some of the
are:

**Spear phishing attacks** :These attacks usually employ gathered information specific to
the victim to more successfully represent the message as being authentic.
Whaling attacks : These are a type of spear phishing attacks that specifically target senior
executives within an organization with the objective of stealing large sums of sensitive
data.

**Pharming**: These are a type of phishing attacks that uses domain name system cache
poisoning to redirect users from a legitimate website to a fraudulent one.

**Voice phishing**: This is a form of phishing that occurs over voice-based media, including
voice over IP (also called vishing). This type of scam uses speech synthesis software to
leave voicemails notifying the victim of suspicious activity in a bank account or credit
account.

**SMS phishing**: This is a mobile device-oriented phishing attack that uses text messaging
to convince victims to disclose account credentials or install malware.

Being a victim of these type of phishing attacks can cause many consequences with some of
them being as severe as identity theft and financial loss. Therefore, individuals should remain
vigilant when dealing with such cybersecurity threats and educate themselves on ways to
detect phishing attempts if they ever occur.

In this project, a dataset which contains a comprehensive collection of features extracted from URLs was analysed. 
For this dataset, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Neural network was used to perform
classification. Also, Multiple Imputation by Chain Equations (MICE) and IsolationForest was
used which will be discussed in the Methods section of the paper. Finally, a discussion of the
results from the methodology and conclusions will be added in the Results section of the
paper.
